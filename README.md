## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3schools.com]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The biggest challenge I came across was figuring out how to include a gif into a readME file. I complete all of my programming work on a PC so I opted to use the built-in Xbox game bar instead of QuickTime. Then I searched online for a converter tool that could synthesize a gif from a .mp4. Once I got that figured out I found a website to host my gif so I can paste the link onto my readME file. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[My question in regards to web development is how to build a database and profile system so users can login to websites. Additionally, how to utilize cookies and add download links for files like pdfs. Are there inexpensive ways to host a website? When would a web developer want to use other frameworks like AWS, Flask, Django, and GCP?  How to communicate with APIs from sites like Google? How to setup a login where new users can use their social media or google account to create a profile quickly? What are the ways to reduce load time for webpages?  How do I make a separate version of the site for mobile devices?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would add more features to the game like levels, more buttons, and a timer. I would build new functions for various levels for the game with each level getting progressively more difficult. The startGame() function would call a particular function based on which level of difficulty the user chose. I was thinking of having four levels in total: easy, medium, hard, and  legendary. If the user selects “hard” they would get a difficult level and if they selected “easy” they would play a much less intensive version of the game. Extra functionality like more buttons and a timer would definitely help in adding difficulty in a creative and engaging way.]
